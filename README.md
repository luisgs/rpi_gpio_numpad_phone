# rpi_gpio_numpad_phone

Do you have an old phone and want to connect it to a RPi so it looks and works as 'it should'. This Project gives a second life to your old phone.

This project explains how to connect a physical phone numpad (0-9 + # *) to a Raspberry B (26 pins only). 

Phone will behave as an old standard land phone where 1/ it reads inputs (from GPIO board), 2/ send audio out (busy and line tones).
